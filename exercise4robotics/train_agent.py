    All inputs should be tensorflow variables!
    We use the following notation:
       N : minibatch size
       A : number of actions
    Required inputs:
       Q_s: a NxA matrix containing the Q values for each action in the sampled states.
            This should be the output of your neural network.
            We assume that the network implments a function from the state and outputs the 
            Q value for each action, each output thus is Q(s,a) for one action 
            (this is easier to implement than adding the action as an additional input to your network)
       action_onehot: a NxA matrix with the one_hot encoded action that was selected in the state
                      (e.g. each row contains only one 1)
       Q_s_next: a NxA matrix containing the Q values for the next states.
       best_action_next: a NxA matrix with the best current action for the next state
       reward: a Nx1 matrix containing the reward for the transition
       terminal: a Nx1 matrix indicating whether the next state was a terminal state
       discount: the discount factor
