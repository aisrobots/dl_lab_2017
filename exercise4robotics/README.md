# Simple RL Exercise
This folder contains the coded that you need to get started with the rl exercise.

The structure is the same as for the last exercise with the change that now you agent has to learn while interacting with the system.

Have a look at train_agent.py to see how this changes your training

NOTE: as an additional requirement for the exercise you should solve, by hand, the maze as described on the exercise sheet (see the course webpage)
